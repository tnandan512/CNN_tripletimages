# Convolutional Neural Network for sets of image triplets

This task focuses on using a pre-trained ResNeXT model to apply to a large set of image triplets of food to essentially predict where food image A would taste more similar to food image B or food image C.

This task is akin to that of training a Siamese netwrok
